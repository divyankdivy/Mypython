# Instructions
1. Read this the code in debugging FizzBuzz
2. Spot the problems üêû.
3. Modify the code to fix the program.
4. The code needs to print the solution to the FizzBuzz game.

Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.

When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".

When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".

And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"
